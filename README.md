# Loggifly Configuration 

While there are some settings you can set via environment variables most of the configuration for Loggifly happens in the config.yaml file.
You can find a detailed walkthrough of the config file [here](https://https://github.com/clemcer/loggifly/blob/main/walkthrough.md).

## üõ† Installation Walkthrough


1. Create a folder on your system, place your [config.yaml](config.yaml) there and edit it to fit your needs and preferences.
```yaml
containers:
    audiobookshelf:
      ntfy_topic: books
      ntfy_tags: books, headphones
      ntfy_priority: 3
      keywords:
        - failed login
        - requested download
        - downloaded item 
 vaultwarden:
      ntfy_tags: closed_lock_with_key
      keywords:
        - Username or password is incorrect
        - regex: incorrect
        - username
        - password
      keywords_with_attachment:
        - regex: ^\[[^\]]+\]\[[^\]]+\]\[(ERROR)\] # catches all lines with Log level ERROR at the beginning (after the timestamp)

global_keywords:
  - segfault
  - panic
  - fatal

# Here you can specify your ntfy or apprise settings. Or both. 
notifications:                          # You could also set these settings via environment variables if you want
  ntfy:                                 
    url: "your url"
    topic: "your topic"
    token: "token"
    tags: kite, mag
  apprise:
    url: discord:// # Your apprise url. For example for Discord
  
settings:
  log-level: INFO
  keyword_notification_cooldown: 5
  attachment_lines: 10 
  disable_shutdown_message: False
  disable_start_message: False
  disable_restart: False
```

### Installation via Docker Compose

2. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project and adjust it to your needs. In the volumes section you will have to specify the path to your config file.
If you want, you can set all of the global settings (that are not defined per container) in your compose via environment variables. Here is a list of the options. (Or use an .env file)

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  Loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/Loggifly:latest
    container_name: Loggifly
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./Loggifly/config/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml # specify the path of your condig file on the left side of the mapping
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Then, run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
